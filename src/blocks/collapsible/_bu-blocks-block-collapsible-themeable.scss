// Collapsible Styles - Configurable
// =================================================================
//
//
// Styles in this file should only be using properties that are
// in the global array ($blocks-defaults) so they can be overwritten by
// the child theme
// Examples: color, border-color, font-family
//
// Variant styles, such as "open", or an alternate layout should be declared here
// as shown below IF that variant needs to modify one of the properties that
// can be overwritten via the array. This lets the child theme overwrite that
// as well.
//
// If you aren't using styles from the global array ($blocks-defaults) by
// using blocks-get() it doesn't belong in this file as it will be printed
// in the stylesheet multiple times (for each publication)
